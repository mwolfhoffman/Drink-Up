## Drink Up

Independent Project to practice using Angular 1.5.x. 

This project makes AJAX requests to BreweryDB's API. This application allows users to browse beers by searching by a beer's name or brewery name. Users must be authenticated by Firebase authentication. Version 1 uses Facebook and Google Authentication. After a user is authenticated they can save beers into their lists. Version 1 uses only local storage, but later versions will use a document storage database.
